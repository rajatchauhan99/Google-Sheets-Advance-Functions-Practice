# Google-Sheets-Advance-Functions-Practice
This repository involved very useful google sheet advance functions such as:

1. Using index and match with multiple conditions. 

2. Creation of pivot tables in the google sheets with action filter. (That is one filter which control all charts and tables.)

3. Data Validation by using list from a range.         

   ( The list of unique items from a column is obtained by using =unique() function. So that we can use it as a filter for our data )

4. Extraction of a particular department data in a different subsheet of the same workbook using query.

   ( And also the query is controlled by the same list filter. )
   
   
5. Finding the top and bottom scores using desc and asc limit keywords of query.
